started from the bottom now we are here
thats a real one in your reflection without a follow without a mention
jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
when all is said and done more is always said than done
you know its real when you are who you think you are
always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
i was born to make mistakes not to fake perfection
sometimes its the journey that teaches you a lot about your destination
i bet if i give all my love then nothing is going to tear us apart
live for today plan for tomorrow party tonight party tonight
life is not a rehearsal the cameras always rolling
the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today
doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment
we always ignore the ones who adore us and adore the ones who ignore us
better late than never but never late is better
