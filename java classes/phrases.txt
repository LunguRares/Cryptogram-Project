started from the bottom now we are here
thats a real one in your reflection without a follow
jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
when all is said and done more is always said than done
you know its real when you are who you think you are
i have nothing to lose but something to gain
i was born to make mistakes not to fake perfection
what is love baby dont hurt me no more
never let your emotions over power your intelligence
change the game dont let the game change you
life is not a rehearsal the cameras always rolling
the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today
somebody just told me the world is gonna roll me
problems are not stop signs they are guidelines
better late than never but never late is better
