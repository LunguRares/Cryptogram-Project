## Assessment Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to provide the opportunity to follow the software development lifecycle within a team. This is an important aspect of being
a professional in the field as it provides structure and consistency, resulting in projects which are more likely to be successful.

An important challenge here is to explore how the software development lifecycle can be applied in a given context. In the assessment for this semester of
Advanced Programming you will be asked to follow a software development lifecycle process in order to develop a Java program to allow users to generate
and solve cryptogram puzzles. This will be completed in teams of four which can be chosen by students so long as it is within their allocated lab group. No
requests to change lab group can be accommodated as personal circumstances will have already been taken into account. In addition to the cryptogram
project, there will be two individual quizzes. Further details are provided closer to the time. 

## Background
Encipherment is a process in which a message is encoded in such a way that it is not readable by someone who does not have the mapping from the original
message to the encoded message. In particular, in classical cryptography a substitution cipher maps each letter in the alphabet for alternative letters or
numbers. Each letter is mapped to a single cipher value. When mapping letters to letters, letters cannot be substituted for themselves.

A cryptogram is a word puzzle where players are presented with an enciphered phrase. The aim of the puzzle is to identify the original message. Players can
employ a number of approaches to achieving this. For example, looking for short words such as 1 letter words, which are ‘I’ or ‘A’ as these are the only two 1
letter words in English. Players can also use the frequency each enciphered letter appears in the puzzle – e.g. the most frequent letter is probably ‘E’ for
messages in English. There may also be common groups of letters such as ‘TH’ or ‘ION’ which may be repeated in the message.
