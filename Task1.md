# Task 1 Iteration 0 User Stories


The first task is to identify the requirements of the project through creation of user stories and consideration of acceptance criteria. The submission for this
stage is the user stories you write. Whilst you are not expected to write and submit all your acceptance criteria, you should spend time considering at least
two appropriate acceptance criteria for each user story as you will be asked about this in the marking lab for this submission. Your submission should contain
no more than 14 user stories.

To write the user stories, it will be necessary first to elicit the requirements through conversation with the lecturer who will act as the product owner and
customer. Requirements elicitation will take the form of questions posed to the lecturer during a lecture slot. Each team will be permitted to ask one question
during a lecture on 28th January 2019. 

It is recommended that teams prepare a few questions, as it may be that another team asks your question before you get an opportunity. Note you will be
best placed to perform well if you commence thinking about the requirements prior to the elicitation session, as general requirements can be gathered from
the details provided in the background. The answers provided serve to provide further clarification where required. Questions similar to “what are the user
stories” will not be answered, but will still count as the question for your team.

In addition to the requirements elicitation session, each team will be allocated a teaching assistant or demonstrator who will act as product owners by proxy
for the lecturer. Your team will check in with your allocated product owner in each of the labs commencing from week 3 and further clarification can be
sought from them. You can of course ask questions of any tutor or demonstrator in the lab who isn’t nominally assigned to your team.

Submission of the list of user stories should be to the appropriate slot on MyPlace by the deadline shown in Table 1. The submission should be a single page
PDF, and should only be submitted by one member of the team though it is the whole team’s responsibility to ensure that the submission made is agreed
upon and on time. The submission slot will be configured as a team submission, meaning all team members will be able to see the submission and hence
check it.

This submission will be marked and feedback provided in person in the labs, see the dates in Table 1. In the lab you will be asked to show the user stories you
submitted on MyPlace, and asked to suggest acceptance criteria for a subset of user stories. The combination of your responses and the submission will be
assessed for your mark in this aspect. See the related marking scheme later in this document.
